Water Supply Network Design and Analysis

Objective:
To design and analyse a water supply network servicing a small industrial estate, focusing on determining the unknown volumetric flow rates in each pipe and the pressure loss from the source to each unit.

Network Specifications: 6 nodes, each linked to an industrial unit. 7 internal pipes and 2 supply pipes from an off-site network with known source pressure. 6 industrial units (Unit 1 to Unit 6).

Tasks:
Determine Flow Rates: Calculate the flow rates (Q) for all pipes in the network.
Calculate Pressure Loss: Determine the pressure loss from the source to each unit.
